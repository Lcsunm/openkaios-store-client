  <h1>Privacy Policy and Terms of use</h1>
  <p>
    Your privacy is important to us, that&#39;s why we try to collect only the
    data that we need to provide the service to you.
  </p>
  <h2>Data that might get collected while using the app</h2>
  <p>
    We rely on gitlab pages for hosting the data, this service might store
    cookies and save your ip address
    <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/"
      >https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/</a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    We only link to the app packages, we don&#39;t host them ourselves so when
    downloading apps you will download them from thirdparty servers who can then
    see your ip address.
  </p>
  <h2>Data that might be shared with third paries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      IP address when browsing apps
      <a href="https://gitlab.com/banana-hackers/store-db/-/issues/13"
        >we plan on fixing that</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>IP address when downloading apps</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Download Counter and ratings</h2>
  <p>
    When using the app we fetch the download count for all apps from our ratings
    server. This request might be logged, but we don&#39;t explicitly store your
    ip address.
  </p>
  <p>
    When downloading apps a request to the download counter will be made to
    increase it, this request contains:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The name of the downloaded app</li>
    <li>the time of the download</li>
    <li>
      The IP address of the user, but its not explicitly saved at the moment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When fetching the ratings for an app the server gets the requested appname
    and the ip address but it is not explicitly saved.
  </p>
  <p>
    When rating apps we store your nickname and your ratings on our server to
    make the service possible.
  </p>
  <h2>Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    Besides from counting downloads we don&#39;t do any analytics. But the apps
    you download might do it, have ads or even track you. We try to label apps
    that have tracking and/or advertisement.
  </p>
  <h2>Liability &amp; Warranty</h2>
  <p>
    This service is community maintained and provided on a best-effort basis. We
    try our best make sure the data is correct, but we do not give any
    warranties that the information is correct. Use this service on your own
    risk.
  </p>
  <h2>Abuse</h2>
  <p>
    If you see an app that violates you rights or does bad stuff with your
    device, please report it on
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/banana-hackers/store-db/-/issues"
      >gitlab issues</a
